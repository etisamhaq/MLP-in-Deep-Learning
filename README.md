# MLP-in-Deep-Learning

Task 1: Implement different perceptrons in Python using the activation functions. This code generates a synthetic dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a perceptron with different 
activation functions, evaluates the accuracy, and plots the decision boundary for 2D data. 

Task 2:
- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh 
- Compute the cross entropy loss 
- Implement forward and backward propagation
