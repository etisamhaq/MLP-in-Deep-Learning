# MLP-in-Deep-Learning
Implement different perceptrons in Python using the activation functions.

This code generates a synthetic dataset, splits it into training and testing sets, trains a perceptron with different 
activation functions, evaluates the accuracy, and plots the decision boundary for 2D data.
